what is microservice ?


all logic to one feature work correctly.



challenge : Data management between services

each service gets its own database.
services never will reach to each other dbs.


it is pattern : Database per service

we want run it independetly.





Sync and Async in microsevices :


Sync : services communicate with each other using direct request
       web of dependency



Async : Services communicate with each other with events. event based
        Event bus , each service emit events or receive events from event
        bus.


second way async communicate :
each service , one db.

how catch our need info from other serivces.

simontinously save to db and send event to Event bus. for any body care 
about it.

spec : list of config options the pod that we are about to create. 


k get pods



deployment is a k8s object that is intended to manage set of pods.
 it check pods exists.

in template labels define label for selector.
